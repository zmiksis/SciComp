Prayer - November 7, 2019

Rev. Andrew Gawrych, C.S.C.

Lord Jesus, like the angels in heaven, may our hearts rejoice
over the sinner who repents, over the doubting who find faith,
over the despairing who find hope, over the lonely who find love.
With you, may we zealously seek out the lost of our world, so
that, like us, they may find their true home in you. Amen.
