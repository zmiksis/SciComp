Checking whether zero_vector really is the zero_vector...
Success, zero_vector really is zero!

Checking whether vector_i is the zero vector...
Success, vector_i is not the zero vector!

Clearing vector_i, and checking to see whether the resulting vector is the zero vector...
Success, vector_i was cleared successfully. Resetting vector_i...

u == (2, 1, 2)
v == (-2, 4, 0)
w == (0, 6, 8)

The length of u is: 3
The length of v is: 4.47214
The length of w is: 10

The dot product of u and v is: 0
The dot product of u and w is: 22
The dot product of v and w is: 24

The angle between u and v is: 1.5708
The angle between u and w is: 0.747584
The angle between v and w is: 1.00433

The cross product of u and v is: (-8, -4, 10)
The cross product of u and w is: (-4, -16, 12)
The cross product of v and w is: (32, 16, -12)

The cross product of u and v is the negative of the cross product of v and u!

Testing whether or not i == j...
(1, 0, 0) is not equal to (0, 1, 0)

Now changing the entries of v...
v is now: (1, 3, 5)
The sum of the entries of v is: 9
